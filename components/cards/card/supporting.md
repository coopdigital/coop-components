<p>Cards should be used:</p>
<ul>
    <li>never on their own &mdash; always in rows of 2 to 4</li>
    <li>for discrete grouped pieces of information within a page</li>
    <li>as links to content that will change over time (such as blog posts) not as navigational signposts to permanent pages</li>
</ul>
