The Cloverleaf Symbol was created in 1968 for project facelift, when all the Co-op societies united under one banner. We now use a modernised version that optimised for modern production methods. For older Co-op members it evokes positive memories, and in new members it represents a new, modern future built on the original Co-operative principles. It is our most important visual asset and works very hard to unite the Co-op brand across our different business sectors.
