Buttons must use:

- Avenir Next Medium at 20px (1em)
- a 7px border radius
- 15px 37.5px padding (as calculated by the browser because we size with em)
- a 4px blue outline on focus and active

Button width should be defined by the content on the button. Buttons should also be ranged left with the left edge aligning with other content.
