Use #00729A (dark blue) as the default colour for text links. You can use #282828 as an alternative if needed — for instance if you are using links on a coloured background.

If you’re using a dark background colour you must do a colour contrast check.

All text links should be underlined regardless of what colour they are.

The mouse-over state must use the hand/pointer to indicate that the link is clickable.

Link text can be read out of context and should always tell the user where it’s taking them — never use ‘click here’. Find out how we write link text.
