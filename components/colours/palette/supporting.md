<p>Use Co-op’s colour palette:</p>
<ul>
    <li>to draw users’ focus to particular content areas</li>
    <li>to give emphasis, depth and highlight to our work where needed</li>
    <li>in the right context — for example don’t use large amounts of colour in a form, it can distract the user</li>
    <li>with restraint — users can read content better when we use limited colour</li>
    <li>to help convey meaning to interaction patterns, for example, for mandatory form fields. Never use colour alone to do this.</li>
    <li>to communicate the Co-op brand — see the brand guidelines</li>
</ul>
