<p>Use:</p>
<ul>
    <li>radio buttons when the user can choose only one answer</li>
    <li>checkboxes when the user can choose multiple answers</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re using either radio buttons or checkboxes:</p>
<ul>
    <li>style them in a way that makes it clear which option or options has been selected</li>
    <li>allow users to click anywhere in the box</li>
    <li>display the options a user can choose from top to bottom, not left to right — this makes it quicker for users to scan</li>
</ul>

<p>Where possible, give users the option to indicate that none of the options apply to them. Some users need this to be an explicit option to know that they can move on.</p>
