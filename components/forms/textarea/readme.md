Use large text areas with caution. Many users find it hard to type, do not like to type or worry about articulating themselves. Large text areas can be daunting and discouraging.

If you have reason to use them, research them using mobile devices. Entering information using touch devices can be especially time-consuming.

If you're using text areas:

scale them appropriately on mobile devices
allow the user to scroll outside of them on touch screen devices
allow users to control the size of the text area by giving it ‘draggable’ corners
show a countdown of remaining characters (if you’re restricting the characters that can be entered in the text area)
